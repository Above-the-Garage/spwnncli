Spwnncli uses the spwnn library next door in the repo to let you play with the spwnn algorihm interactively.

Here are the commands:

* Just enter a word and it will print the results and some data
* -e or -q
  * exit the program
* -g <optional letters>
  * run the verification on all words that start with <letters>, or omit it, and do them all
* -m
  * print the maximum size of a neural chain
* -p xy
  * print all the words associated with the neuron rooted at the two letters provided
* -s
  print out the size of all the neurons
