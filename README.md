  * exit the program
* -g \<optional letters\>
  * run the verification on all words that start with \<optional letters\>, or leave it blank and do entire alphabet
* -m
  * print the maximum size of a neural chain
* -p xy
  * print all the words associated with the neuron rooted at the two letters provided
